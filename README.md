# Happiness-Predictor
My first independent attempt at working through the entire ML workflow. The models in this project were trained on the 2018 World Happiness Report dataset. A GUI is included for the KNN mode, created using Gradio.

**ML PIPELINE:**

Check out "Happiness Predictor Report.pdf" or "DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb" (for the actual Jupyter notebook file) to see how I prepared my data and trained my models!

For a user-friendly experience, make sure to run "WHR.py" with the two pickle files ("WHR_KNN_scaler.pkl" and "WHR_LifeLadder_Regression_Model.pkl") under the same project folder to make predictions with my KNN model.
